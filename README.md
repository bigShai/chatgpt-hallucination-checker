## What it does

ChatGPT and other large language models hallucinate — they generate confident, fluent responses that contain factual errors. The problem is there's no signal when it's happening. Correct and incorrect information is delivered with identical tone and certainty.

TheGPTChecker lets you paste any ChatGPT response and instantly see:

- Which specific claims are **accurate**
- Which claims are **inaccurate** — and why
- Which claims are **unverifiable**
- An overall **accuracy score** for the response

## Why this matters

LLM hallucination is a well-documented problem across all major models:

- Studies show error rates ranging from **15% to over 50%** depending on the domain
- Errors are most common in **statistics, dates, quotes, citations, and recent events**
- Models frequently cite **sources that don't exist**
- The same confident tone is used for both facts and fabrications

This is especially risky when using AI for **school assignments, research, medical questions, legal information, or professional work**.

## Who it's for

- **Students** verifying AI-generated content before submitting assignments
- **Researchers** cross-checking AI summaries against real sources

## The hallucination problem

> "ChatGPT doesn't know what it doesn't know. It fills gaps with plausible-sounding information — and it never hesitates."

Common hallucination types caught by TheGPTChecker:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Fabricated statistics | "Studies show 73% of people..." (no such study exists) |
| Wrong dates | Incorrect years for historical events |
| Fake citations | Papers, books, or articles that were never published |
| Misattributed quotes | Real people, words they never said |
| Outdated facts | Information that changed after training cutoff |
| Plausible but wrong | Figures that sound reasonable but are off by 2x |
